## System.out.println("Thiago Lopes")

I'm a student Java developer passionate about learning and building real-world applications. I focus on writing clean, reusable code and enjoy exploring how APIs and the Spring ecosystem can solve practical problems.
Iâ€™m currently sharpening my skills by working on personal projects that involve API integration and back-end development. I'm also dedicated to improving my knowledge of object-oriented programming.
Curious by nature, I like challenging myself to grow both technically and creatively. Whether it's learning something new in Java or refining my logic with LeetCode-style exercises, I'm always aiming to level up.
